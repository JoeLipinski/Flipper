## Flipper
This is a collection of various FlipperZero scripts, settings and tools that I compiled from several sources.

## Installation
Install by adding the resources in each folder to the same folder on your flipper.

## Support
Feel free to submit an issue if you have any questions or issues. I plan on updating this repo as I find or create more helpful resources. I am open to contributions. Please feel free to contact me if you want to contribute.

## Authors and acknowledgment
I compiled this list a while ago and I lost track of where a lot of these resrouces came from, so if I am using you work, I'm sorry for the lack of attribution, but thank you!
